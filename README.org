* Search and insert the right issue at "Fixes #"

Goal: In a magit commit buffer, I want to complete the issue when I type
"Fixes #".

I was jealous about a SublimeText plugin.

This is now done with Helm.

** Usage
Activate the minor mode
: M-x git-commit-insert-issue-mode

In a magit  commit buffer (=git-commit-mode=), type "Fixes  #" (or [[https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/][any
other keyword understood by github]]) and choose the issue from the helm
list.

So to always activate it:
: (add-hook 'git-commit-mode-hook 'git-commit-insert-issue-mode)

** Dependencies

- [[https://github.com/inkel/github-issues.el][github-issues]] (NOT in melpa)
- helm

** Todo

- everything
- and gitlab.
