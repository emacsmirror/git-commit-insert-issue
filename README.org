* Search and insert the right issue at "Fixes #"

Goal: In a magit commit buffer, I want to complete the issue when I type
"Fixes #".

I was jealous about a SublimeText plugin, this is now done with Helm.

** Usage
Activate the minor mode
: M-x git-commit-insert-issue-mode

In a magit  commit buffer (=git-commit-mode=), type "Fixes  #" (or [[https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/][any
other keyword understood by github]]) and choose the issue from the helm
list.

So to always activate it:
: (add-hook 'git-commit-mode-hook 'git-commit-insert-issue-mode)

** Dependencies

- [[https://github.com/inkel/github-issues.el][github-issues]] (not in melpa, but we included a copy)
- helm
- projectile
- s.el

** Issues

- if you play too much with it, you can reach github's rate limit.

[[https://github.com/inkel/github-issues.el/issues][Issues of github-issues.el]] :

# export: both uses an org table with many columns. Eval with C-c-c
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
#2 - MELPA ?
#1 - Doesn't work on private repos.
(--map (insert (concat it "\n")) (issues-get-issues "inkel" "github-issues.el"))
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none
;;(issues-get-issues "inkel" "github-issues.el")
#+END_SRC



** Todo

- tests
- cache
- gitlab
